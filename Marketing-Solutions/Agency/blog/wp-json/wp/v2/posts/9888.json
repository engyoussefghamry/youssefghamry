This would allow the various listings that you have to come up when the users search for a specific set of keywords in the search bar on the site. This would allow you to be able to see which full or shorter keywords are going to pull up your products and where they rank. There are a few terms that you would need to know, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword is a phrase or single words that are put into use when it comes to targeting new potential traffic<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search term is the phrase or exact word that a customer would search for or enter in the search bar for Amazon<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have understood what these key terms are, then you would be able to understand more about the process and what is required.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Basics_of_Amazon_Indexing\"><\/span><b>Basics of Amazon Indexing<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most commonly used method when it comes to the site for customers finding what they need are by searching. If your products are properly indexed, then they will come up in the search results when the users are searching for various items. The correlation is direct when it comes to your revenue and the relevant purchase-based intent keywords. This means that the keywords that you have associated with your products are the ones that will bring it up in the search results when they are used like \u201cgarlic press\u201d and much more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The search results that are brought up to the viewer after they do their search is based on the indexing of the site. You should ensure that you are using all of the appropriate keywords so that you aren\u2019t being missed out when it comes to any searches and potential customers. This is important because if you don\u2019t have the indexing done right, then you aren\u2019t going to come up in the search results and others are going to get the sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Does_This_Mean-2\"><\/span><b>What Does This Mean?\u00a0<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another question that you might have is what does this mean? The site has a specific method that you would need to use when it comes to uploading all of your products, including the information and the description. There are numerous things that you won\u2019t have to worry about that you do with Google like canonical errors, <\/span><a href=\"\/blog\/404-errors-that-are-killing-your-seo-efforts\/\"><b>crawl errors<\/b><\/a>,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and even <\/span><a href=\"\/blog\/summary-on-spammy-structured-markup-penalty\/\"><b>schema markup<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The format is specific and that means you have a detailed instructions of what you would need to have put up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are only a certain number of keywords that you would be able to use when it comes to your pages, so make sure that you are using the best ones. Being indexed simply means that your product is being seen on the search results when the keywords are being searched for in Amazon. This would bring up your products to all customers who are looking to purchase something and can help to increase your sales, income and much more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Keywords\"><\/span>1.

You should make sure that you know what each of them means, so here is what you should know, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Indexing\"><\/span>2. Indexing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You either have the keywords indexed or you don\u2019t and if you do, then you are going to come up in the results. However, if you don\u2019t, then you aren\u2019t going to be in the results. This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with where you sit when it comes to the results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Ranking\"><\/span><b>3. Ranking\u00a0<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the rank that your product would be shown as when it comes to the search results. You can track for various keywords so that you can see where your ranking is and if it goes down or increases over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Relevancy\"><\/span><b>4. Relevancy<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would help to determine whether or not the keywords that you are using are relevant to the products. This would help to increase the conversion of your sales along with the standards that are set by the site when it comes to running ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are all things that you would need to consider when it comes to the keywords that you are using, so make sure that you are picking the best ones that are going to bring more customers to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Do_the_Indexing\"><\/span>How to Do the Indexing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also should be thinking about how you can get the indexing on the site done. There are a few data structures that you are going to want to think about when it comes to the placement of the keywords, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Structured data<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back end search keywords<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bullets<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these areas would need to use the keywords so make sure that you have figured out how you are going to implement them smoothly and without any issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Checking_Your_Listing_for_Indexing\"><\/span>Checking Your Listing for Indexing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the required changes have been made to the listing, then you would want to check and make sure that they are indexed. You should give it around 24 hours before you do any searches to see about the indexing and there are some steps to follow to see how effective it is. The steps include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening up the site and making sure that all categories is selected<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Type in the ASIN or Amazon Standard Identification Number for the product you want to check as well as the keyword.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Press enter and see if the product comes up in the search results<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the product that you have listed does come up in the search result, then your indexing has been successful. However, if it isn\u2019t indexed you aren\u2019t going to get any results and you would see no results were found. You can check these by doing the searches manually or you can use one of the top tools that would allow you to check easily. Make sure that you are checking this every time you are doing the indexing for a new product to ensure that it is going to be coming up when the searches are done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot that you would need to do to ensure that your products are coming up during the searches on Amazon. You should be indexing all of your products and that means that the keywords that you are using need to be placed everywhere for it to work. You should also know the steps that will help you to check and see if the results are what you are hoping for and much more.
