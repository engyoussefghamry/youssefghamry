Before we jump to the URL and its importance in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/seo-services.html\">SEO services<\/a> and digital marketing. We need to pay attention to the basics of the URL. What is the URL and how it is a key factor of any website? Also, a big question is how the URL plays a significant role in online marketing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Is_An_URL\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is An URL?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and it is a unique link or address given to any web page on the internet. We browse all the websites through URLs. In common language, people know it as links. It is known as a link because it links one web page or website with other webpages. It is similar to a physical location address. Internet users fill up URLs in their web browsers, and their browser client takes them to the exact location of that URL.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.example.com<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Is_The_Difference_Between_HTTP_And_HTTPS_URL\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is The Difference Between HTTP And HTTPS URL<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some URLs start with HTTP and some URLs are there that are used with HTTPS. But what does it mean? And what is the actual difference behind these two types of URLs? The letter \u2018s\u2019 is representing an extra security layer. It is more useful to use HTTPS rather than HTTP.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/how-to-do-keywords-analysis-research\/\">How To Do Keywords Analysis?<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Is_URL_Structure\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is URL Structure?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we are regulating and paying attention to the URL, then it is known as a structured URL. In SEO, we pay huge attention to the structure. If URLs are not structured it won&#8217;t be easy for you to get more traffic. Your website has a major URL and along with it, there are different URLs for different web pages of your website. All of them have to be structured. There are different ways to structure URLs, according to the type of website. If you are an eCommerce website owner, then you should use a structure which helps your customers understand about the page and its content. And more your site visitors seem familiar URLs, more they will get involved with your site and more visits and traffic will be there.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Importance_Of_URL_Structure\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance Of URL Structure<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Structure of URL is important because it provides different facilities to webmasters. There are different benefits we get from URLs. It is one of the most effective features which takes no time. But when we see the importance of the structure of URL, then we will realize how much importance it has. But structuring URLs is not that difficult. So indirectly you are getting more value after a few efforts only. That is why no digital marketer is there who opposes or ignores the URLs and their structure. As we have mentioned that the structure of URLs cannot be similar for all the websites. News and media websites will have different types of structure, which may contain date and time of posting, location of post and a few keywords related to the news. On the other hand, eCommerce websites have URLs, those represent the product category, catalogue, product, etc. Following are some of the important factors that the structure has with it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Part_Of_SEO\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part Of SEO<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No need to mention it again that the structure of URL is a part of SEO. As a digital marketer or small online business owner, you should know that the URL and its structure is always counted when we are talking about search engine optimization. So whenever you are developing an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/10-essential-seo-strategies-for-e-commerce-sites\/\">SEO strategy<\/a> or going to start an SEO campaign you must include the URL and its proper structure according to the type of website that you own.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"User_Experience\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User Experience<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User experience is the key factor around which the whole online marketing and SEO campaigns evolve. Many search engines also stated that the user experience is the major thing that you should focus on. And do you know that URLs are directly linked up with user experience? You will be enhancing the user experience of your visitors with URL. We are not saying that URLs are the only factor to play behind user experience. But it is one of them.
