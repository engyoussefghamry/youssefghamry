400;\">Availability and accessibility<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These two aspects of web usability are the most fundamental pillars. First, let&#8217;s talk about availability on your website. Here availability means that the website is available to access all the time and there should not be any server downtime. It is because, if the server is down, the bounce rate will increase and will harm the overall website&#8217;s credibility. And when it comes to accessibility, it means that the website is accessible on every mobile device. To improve these factors, focus on the below aspects:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Server_uptime\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Server uptime:<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s important while choosing the hosting plan that the server uptime is higher and it offers uninterrupted services. The majority of the hosting service providers offer uptime up to 99.8% and you won&#8217;t have such downtime. But you should not be taking any chances on the uptime of your website. If possible, go for cloud hosting which is dedicated and offers you seamless service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Fix_broken_links\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fix broken links<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broken links are terrible for your website and it hampers the overall website usability. When a user clicks on the link and it&#8217;s broken, then the visitor jumps to another website and they might not come back. So, It&#8217;s important that you audit your website for broken links and fix them on priority. As search engines also pay great attention to links, it&#8217;s important that you ensure no links are<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/404-errors-that-are-killing-your-seo-efforts\/\"> 404 on your website<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mobile_responsiveness\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile responsiveness<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/pros-cons-of-responsive-web-design\/\">Mobile responsiveness<\/a> is among the hottest and most important aspects of website usability that you need to focus on. Mobile responsiveness ensures that all the pages are loading seamlessly on every mobile device. Be it the navigation, menu, or the buttons and the content, everything needs to be responsive so that the maximum audience can access your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Focus_on_clarity\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on clarity<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clarity is strongly linked with the website usability factor and you need to focus on improving it. Clarity refers to the ability of how well your audience can understand your content and take the necessary action to grow your business. There should not be any element in the website that will confuse or misguide the visitors. The interface should be clean and simplistic so that the users don&#8217;t get confused about taking any action. While you design new landing pages or optimize the existing pages, make sure the call to action is clear and most people will understand what you want them to do. If you want them to subscribe to your email list, or buy products, the CTA should be clear and precise. To establish more clarity on your website, follow these factors:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on what&#8217;s most important for the users and what actions do you want them to take to grow your business. If the CTA is confusing, consider redesigning it.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t experiment too much with the design and there should be some elements that are familiar to the visitors and the audience will not get confused.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on establishing a consistent layout throughout the website. It should not feel like visiting another website while switching from one page to another.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to implement a quick guide so that your visitors can navigate through the important pages.
