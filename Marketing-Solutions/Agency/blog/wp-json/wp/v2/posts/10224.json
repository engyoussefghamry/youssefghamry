While it often is quite an expensive endeavor, it is most certainly a very high return investment. Here are the major benefits:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>It will considerably increase your market share both nationally and internationally<\/li>\n<li>Your business will see a more significant influx of revenue<\/li>\n<li>It will build the right brand image due to eliminating cultural sensitivities<\/li>\n<li>It will allow you to connect with your customers and drive loyalty<\/li>\n<li>You will have a considerable edge over your competition<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, an unlocalized app or website experience is relatively problematic for users.

Localized design demands space<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Languages come in a large variety of shapes and sizes, and they very often drastically differ from a word length perspective.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you begin working on a localized design, it\u2019s essential to take into account the length of each linguistic component on your site or interface. Ironically, this is the least technical aspect of designing a site, yet it has the most potential to ruin the user\u2019s experience with it. So it\u2019s our responsibility to start obsessing with space in the earlier phases of the process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Andrew Kahneman, a localization professional at <a href=\"https:\/\/thewordpoint.com\/services\/translation-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TheWordPoint<\/a>, told us that many languages from the Latin family, like German, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Romanian will generally demand more space than their equivalents in English, something designers should be aware of when designing for the European market.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below, you\u2019ll find an example of the word \u201cviews\u201d translated into multiple European and Asian languages to exemplify the difference.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10226\" style=\"width: 354px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10226\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10226\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/07122307\/W3C.png\" alt=\"W3C\" width=\"344\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/07122307\/W3C.png 344w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/07122307\/W3C-300x287.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-10226\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Source:\u00a0W3C<\/em><\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re designing a site for a character-based language such as Korean, Chinese, Hindi, and so forth, it\u2019s essential to make some changes to the font size. Here are a few basic recommendations that will considerably improve the text\u2019s readability:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>You\u2019ll have to make the fonts smaller. On average by around 15-20%.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ll have to make adjustments regarding line-height. Increase it by approximately 15-20% as well.<\/li>\n<li>You should also make adjustments to the length of the rows you place your text in. It\u2019s best to keep it at around 18 &#8211; 38 symbols or characters for desktop and about 14-20 for smartphones.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Incorporate_cultural_content\"><\/span>2. Incorporate cultural content<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Little details that relate to an individual country\u2019s culture can have a massive impact on how your brand is going to be accepted in a new market. It will allow you to connect with the local users and show that you are aware of their cultural peculiarities and that you\u2019re respectful towards their heritage. You can also consider localizing your logo and other brand-specific graphic elements by integrating small cultural elements in them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Culture is an essential instrument humans use to navigate the world around them. So it\u2019s safe to say that the culture we belong to is in a way descriptive of the products and services we pay for, and also how we use them in day-to-day life. And while using cultural content is a simple and straightforward way to cater to a new audience, organizations need to be very careful in regards to the topics they touch when localizing their design or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/online-reputation-management-services.html\">branding<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Adjust_to_the_local_palette_and_taste\"><\/span>3. Adjust to the local palette and taste<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Localizing a website\u2019s design, however, goes much further than just adding cultural content and adapting the text to a particular culture. It\u2019s safe to assume that, generally speaking, certain countries have specific tastes, which are especially visible when compare to other countries\u2019 standards.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let\u2019s take a look at how the same company has adapted their website for the French and the American markets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10227 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/07122311\/orangelocalization.jpg\" alt=\"orange localization\" width=\"1028\" height=\"905\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/07122311\/orangelocalization.jpg 1028w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/07122311\/orangelocalization-300x264.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/07122311\/orangelocalization-768x676.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/07122311\/orangelocalization-1024x901.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1028px) 100vw, 1028px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What immediately strikes the eye is the difference in the color palette and saturation. The colors Orange used in the French version are less animated and somewhat muted, while the localized American version features larger patches of intense colors such as light purple, orange, blue, and yellow.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Reading_gravity\"><\/span>4. Reading gravity<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reading gravity is an essential concept in user experience design. It regards the pattern in which people tend to read and skim information on a web page. The common standard is the so-called F-shaped pattern.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While this is the commonly accepted standard in design, it is of course predominantly applicable in Western countries, due to the fact that these cultures read left-to-right, while Arabic countries use an inverse reading direction. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to replicate the \u201creverse F\u201d pattern for right-to-left reading cultures.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Localization is a very complex procedure that stems from linguistic adaptation and cultural translation and it has a fairly broad spectrum of benefits ranging from increased brand loyalty and higher conversion rates to more significant revenue.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ultimately, the central idea of a localized website is bridging a meaningful communication with markets that your company hasn\u2019t explored yet. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to elegantly incorporate cultural content into your site\u2019s branding and take the reading gravity into account.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, consider making the necessary adjustments to the font layout, based on the type of language you\u2019re dealing with.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By applying these basic principles into your design localization strategy, you\u2019ll most definitely establish a more meaningful connection with your potential clients.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twenty years ago, the internet was predominantly English-speaking, and only about 6.8% of the world\u2019s population was on it.
