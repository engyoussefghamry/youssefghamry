For now, we\u2019ll provide you with an understanding of why you need them. Let\u2019s dive into specific examples to show you how you can benefit from implementing SEO reporting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe number of organic visitors\u201d is a must metric in your report, so let\u2019s start with this one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a very important metric to focus on as it will help you have a clear understanding of how your actions encouraged internet users to engage with your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to track your organic traffic with the help of well-known Google Analytics by going to Acquisition &gt; All Traffic &gt; Channels &gt; Organic Search.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because SEO reporting is not about writing down numbers, when you\u2019re tracking organic traffic, it\u2019s important to dive deeper into what pages users are landing on. This way you know exactly what content attracts more visitors and can start analyzing the reasons for it in order to implement changes for an increase in traffic and, accordingly, higher rankings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, it would be beneficial to figure where all your traffic comes from. To do it go to Google Analytics again, click on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquisition &gt; All Traffic &gt; Source\/Medium, and use the obtained data to know where to focus your money and efforts<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second metric we\u2019ll take as an example is \u201cConversion\u201d. Because the end result of any marketing activity is the overall revenue it has brought,\u00a0 SEO specialists use this metric to know exactly how many visitors ended up as real clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The desired action that you want your users to take may vary depending on your business type. It can be a completed purchase, paid membership signup, preceded download of an e-book, a newsletter subscription, and many more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to track those actions, webmasters use call-to-action buttons or special pages to be able to monitor interactions. At this point, our job is to know the exact number of converted visitors into leads or customers in order to know whether<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> our efforts have paid off and what we should be doing next.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is why this metric is highly important because you can track the impact of your SEO efforts and be able to calculate your ROI (Return On Investment).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To measure conversions just go to your Google Analytics and click on \u201cAdmin\u201d. From here you can navigate to the \u201cView\u201d block and click on \u201cGoals\u201d. Remember to assign a monetary value to your goal if your aim is to calculate your ROI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1032415?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google\u2019s official guide about how to set up goals in Google Analytics <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in case you strive for more in-depth information.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you\u2019ve set up your goal, give it a month to gather data and then begin measuring the overall outcomes of your SEO efforts. To do it just follow the following steps. First, go again to your Google Analytics, click on Acquisition &gt; All Traffic &gt; Channels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, you must focus solely on the second row called Organic Search.
