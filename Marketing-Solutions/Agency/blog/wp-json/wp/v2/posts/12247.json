class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) is known for ranking your site on the top of a search engine. But there is something more that one must know about it. SEO is part of organic marketing. Organic search engine marketing takes effort and time, but when it comes to the results. Then the results that come out of SEO are awesome. SEO is used to optimize the whole website to get it ranked higher on the search engine result pages (SERPs). SEO is not just a trick that can turn your website into a profitable one overnight. But you can get a huge long-term benefit out of it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_Of_SEO\"><\/span><b>Types Of SEO<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are different types of SEO. Like there are black hat SEO tricks, etc. But we are going to talk about the basic and most common classification of SEO. The most common classification of SEO is mentioned below. This classification is purely based on the type of SEO that you need to run while going with the organic marketing path.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Technical_SEO\"><\/span><b>Technical SEO<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first one is technical SEO. Technical SEO stands for the technical side optimization of the website. You have to optimize the complete website technically. There are many technical aspects like HTML codes, backend, data structure, site structure, site maps, etc. All these factors come under <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/complete-technical-seo-audit-checklist\/\">technical SEO<\/a>. Without optimizing these technical aspects, you cannot expect more from any other SEO campaign that you are running.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"On-Page_SEO\"><\/span><b>On-Page SEO<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-page SEO is simply defined by its name. You have to optimize the on-page content of your website. In this, you need some keywords and meta tags. These tags and keywords will be used to optimize every piece of content on your website. It will help you gain more traffic because on-page content is what attracts more leads or customers. That is why the most common type among the three types of SEO is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/what-is-on-page-seo-services\/\">on-page SEO<\/a>. Without on-page SEO it is not possible to get your content published higher on the Google Search Engine Result Page (SERPs).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Off-Page_SEO\"><\/span><b>Off-Page SEO<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-page SEO is exactly the opposite of on-page SEO. Off-page SEO deals with the content published for your website on other websites. Here in this type of off-page SEO, you have to optimize the content with various SEO tricks. You have to redirect the traffic from other sources to your website with the help of SEO. Different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/seo-trends-tips\/\">SEO tricks<\/a> are used in off-page SEO. From social media sharing to backlinks, everything is very important in off-page SEO. It gives authentic and proven results to the businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_SEO_Works_For_Businesses\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How SEO Works For Businesses?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\u2019s come to the point. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/how-does-seo-work-for-small-businesses\/\">How does SEO work for businesses<\/a>? A business that is looking for search engine optimization (SEO), needs to establish an online presence. Without an online presence like websites or social media accounts, you cannot go ahead with search engine optimization. So the first thing that you need to focus on is to establish some of the online visibility. After that, you will start working on search engine optimization. SEO works differently for different types of businesses. Let\u2019s divide all the business types into major three types of businesses. The first one is the local business. SEO will be different for the local business as compared to the global business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Local_Businesses\"><\/span><b>Local Businesses<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local businesses need to run local SEO campaigns. These campaigns are very important and a little bit different from the global SEO campaigns. Because here you are not going to follow the global trends. Also, the target audience for such kinds of businesses is different. There will be more location-targeted audiences. So with a location-based audience, you will need local keywords and locally related content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Global_Businesses\"><\/span><b>Global Businesses<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global businesses are also focusing on SEO and the campaigns they run are a little different from the local businesses. Here you will require some global keywords and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/10-essential-seo-strategies-for-e-commerce-sites\/\">global SEO strategy<\/a>. Along with this, you will be targeting various locations with location pages. Global trends will be followed in this type of search engine optimization campaign. You will find that there is much more to do when you are targeting a global audience. Your content must be optimized in a way to target that global audience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read<\/strong> &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/how-much-should-i-pay-for-local-seo\/\">How Much Should I Pay For Local SEO<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Importance_Of_SEO\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance Of SEO<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\u2019s understand why SEO is important for every business.
