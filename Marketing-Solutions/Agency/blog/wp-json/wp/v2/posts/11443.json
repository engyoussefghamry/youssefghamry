Most people out there don&#8217;t know who their actual competitors are. If you don&#8217;t know your actual competitors then it won&#8217;t be good for your competitor&#8217;s analysis. You must have to make a list of competitors and their behavior. Many businesses in your niche will be startups and many would be much bigger companies. So, to make the analysis straightforward and meaningful, it\u2019s instrumental to find the right ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Also, Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/blog\/how-to-outsource-your-seo-projects\/\">How To Outsource Your SEO Projects? \u2013 Tips To Follow<\/a><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Make_A_List_Of_Their_Strengths\"><\/span><b>Make A List Of Their Strengths<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have the list of your actual competitors the next thing you have to do in <\/span><b>the competitive analysis <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is to make a list of the strengths of your competitors. But keep in mind here we are analyzing the digital marketing purpose only. So you have to figure out the things that are related to digital marketing. These things can be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/ppc-services-india.html\">PPC campaigns<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/seo-services.html\">SEO<\/a>, traffic, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/social-media-marketing-services.html\">social media campaigns<\/a>, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"See_What_They_Are_Doing\"><\/span><b>See What They Are Doing<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you have to see what your competitors are doing in actuality. All of them will be doing different things on different platforms. There are thousands of digital marketing tactics to practice. So you must check all of the activities of your rivals in terms of digital marketing.

Now at this step, you have two reports. One is the base report which you have prepared using your data. The next report is your competitor&#8217;s report. Now compare everything and then analyze to make the final report. After the final report is prepared you have to make an action plan to do better than your rivals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Competitive analysis <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is not easy if you don&#8217;t have everything planned professionally.
