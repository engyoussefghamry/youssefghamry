is the latest development by Google. It means that the Search Engine will predominantly use the content\u2019s mobile version for indexing and ranking. Earlier, the desktop version of the content of a page was used for indexing when evaluating a page\u2019s relevancy as per a user\u2019s query. With more and more people using their mobile phones for accessing Google, the index is primarily using the page content\u2019s mobile version going forward. Thus, only one index is being used with Googlebot primarily crawling and indexing pages with the smartphone agent. Only that URL will be shown which is most relevant and appropriate to users in the Search results. The whole focus is to ensure an amazing experience for the users and site owners. Every site is individually evaluated on its readiness for mobile first indexing by site transitioning, and the best practices opted for in this regard.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Make_Sure_Your_Site_is_Ready_for_Mobile_First_Indexing\"><\/span><strong>How to Make Sure Your Site is Ready for Mobile First Indexing<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">It is imperative to check if your site is ready for mobile first indexing. With excessive mobile use for accessing Google, it is high time; site owners make it more mobile-friendly. Many factors need to be considered while ensuring the same. Some of the major factors are-<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Use_Responsive_Design\"><\/span><strong><em>Use Responsive Design<\/em><\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The first and the foremost factor that needs to be looked into is having a <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youssefghamry.icu/Marketing-Solutions/Agency\/responsive-web-design-services.html\">responsive website design<\/a><\/strong>. If the site is responsive, it becomes more accessible for the target customers. The content must be just like water, able to take form and shape as per the receptacle in which it is placed. It is important to note that the content is same whether, on a desktop or a mobile phone, only its form is updated. Mobile users can easily access a responsively designed website using the Google search engine. They need not open their desktop to check out a website.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8795\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/07121402\/Mobile-first-indexing.jpg\" alt=\"Responsive Design\" width=\"1024\" height=\"689\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Optimize_Your_Content_For_Mobile\"><\/span><strong><em>Optimize Your Content For Mobile<\/em><\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">If a separate m. The subdomain is being used currently to manage the mobile experience; it may be possible that you are serving different content on mobile and desktop. If that is the case, the impact of mobile first indexing will be immense on your site. Understand that desktop content is responsible for current rankings. Thus, despite having a responsive website design, there may be a need for design tweaks here and there to ensure the optimal mobile experience for conversions. You can optimize content for mobile by using drop-down menus and accordion properly, avoiding flash, keeping a check on pop-ups, tap target, text size, and padding.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Create_a_Mobile-First_Strategy\"><\/span><strong><em>Create a Mobile-First Strategy<\/em><\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">If you wish to act on a mobile-first strategy, it is imperative that you <strong><a href=\"\/blog\/how-to-create-mobile-seo-strategy-for-your-business\/\">create and think mobile first strategy<\/a><\/strong>. Right from website designing, development and more to UX, mobile first must be considered. The mindset needs to be changed and focus on mobile first and then thinking about desktop later. Just having a responsive website is not enough, it should be properly optimized for mobile. Just leave the desktop behind and work with a focused approach on mobile first. Drive organizational change and embrace the mobile-first world. In the long run, this decision is going to be worth it.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Fast_Load_Speed\"><\/span><strong><em>Fast Load Speed<\/em><\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong><a href=\"\/blog\/why-page-load-speed-is-important-for-your-website\/\">Fast load speed<\/a><\/strong> is also going to be one of the major factors that are going to be considered by Google for Mobile first indexing. Thus, is a site doesn\u2019t get loaded at a fast speed, it stands the chance of getting down-ranked in SERP\u2019s or Search Engine Results Pages. Site owners who thought that the loading speed is not going to be a deterrent when it comes to mobile first indexing need to rethink their position. Google is expected to launch a new way to calculate mobile page load speed which is going to become one of the major factors in indexing.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8796 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/07121421\/Page-Speed-Insight.png\" alt=\"Website page Speed\" width=\"561\" height=\"329\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Serve_the_Same_Structured_Markup\"><\/span><strong><em>Serve the Same Structured Markup<\/em><\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Serving <strong><a href=\"\/blog\/6-ways-to-find-fix-structured-data-markup-errors\/\">structured data markup<\/a><\/strong> for both desktop and mobile version is important. Sites can verify the structured markup across mobile and desktop versions and its equivalence. It is done by just typing the URLs of both versions for comparing the output in the structured data testing tool. When a mobile site is added with structured data, it is imperative to avoid the addition of large markup amounts that is very low on relevance to the precise information of each content in a document. Thus, it is better to serve the same structured markup in both versions.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Verify_your_Mobile_Site_in_Search_Console\"><\/span><strong><em>Verify your Mobile Site in Search Console<\/em><\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">When the site is being switched over to mobile first index, the notification is sent by Google through the Search Console. Before and after the switch is being done, many site owners may wish to check out the crawl activity of Google. Log file data needs to be monitored to see the way search engine bots access a website and check out the way they get there. In case, there is increased activity by smartphone agents, it will be immediately noticed, and site owners will be alerted.
