Lay the Groundwork<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When done right, influencer marketing can empower your business growth.<br \/>\nThe first step to influencer marketing is to identify the right social media platform where your target audience has an active presence. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instagram for beauty and fashion brands<br \/>\nTwitch for the video game industry<br \/>\nLinkedIn for B2B companies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Get started with one network and then expand to other networks for cross-platform influencer marketing.<br \/>\nOnce you find the right network to reach your target audience, you can look for the most influential personalities on those platforms. Then recruit them to build an army of influencers to <a href=\"\/blog\/ueo-user-experience-optimization-boost-business\/\">boost your brand<\/a> visibility.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Handpick_Your_Influencers\"><\/span>2. Handpick Your Influencers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Using influencer marketing tools, you can easily search for influencers based on budget, location, industry, or other parameters. It\u2019s crucial to properly vet prospective influencers with defined metrics or characteristics relevant for your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the number of followers is a vanity metric on its own. But the number of followers in ratio to the number of likes, shares, and comments is the engagement rate, which reveals how influential they are with their followers.<\/p>\n<p>Their ability to tell brand stories effectively is another factor to consider. Take a quick look through their posts to check if they have done sponsored content before. See how good they are at weaving in brand mentions with their personal experiences.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10479\" style=\"width: 753px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10479\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10479\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/07122910\/Handpick-Your-Influencers.png\" alt=\"Handpick Your Influencers\" width=\"743\" height=\"500\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-10479\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Instagram<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Kristal Heradia, who collaborated with Forever21 Plus, is a perfect example of a highly effective micro-influencer. She drove a whopping 25.1% engagement rate with only 13.8k followers at the time of the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>To evangelize your brand and share your story, you can handpick influencers who are relevant to your niche. And to effectively do that, ask the following three questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is their engagement rate?<\/li>\n<li>Have they done sponsored content before?<\/li>\n<li>Does your brand values align with theirs?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are satisfied with the answers to the above question, you may have found the right influencers for your next successful marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Decide_on_Your_End_Goal\"><\/span>3. Decide on Your End Goal<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>For the success of your influencer marketing campaign, everyone involved needs to work toward one common goal. This will ensure better coordination between different teams. The desired objective will also dictate the kind of content you\u2019ll need influencers to create.<\/p>\n<p>Following is a list of brand awareness goals you can choose from:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop brand affinity<\/li>\n<li>Become a thought leader<\/li>\n<li>Drive more website traffic<\/li>\n<li>Earn backlinks to your website<\/li>\n<li>Increase sales and revenue for your business<\/li>\n<li>Increase followers on your social media pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you pick your goals, define each of them with very specific details and monitor your campaign over a set of relevant key performance indicators (KPIs).
